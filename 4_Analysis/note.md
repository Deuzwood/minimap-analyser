# Note on openCV

Functions provided by openCV are uncomplete, they do not work everytime for each champions.

If functions depend of champions and not from positions :
we may in this ordrer:

create fake map :

-   foreach function cv2:
-   use on function to detect champions
-   add fitness in array

given two function x,y
given one champ a
`a[x=1,y=0]`
